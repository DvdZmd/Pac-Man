Pac-Man implementation in SDL for C++


The Ghosts behaviours was copied 
in most part from the original game
with a few small differences.

Blinky, the red, 
chase Pac-Man following 
him directly from behind.
Pinky, the pink, chase 
by three tiles ahead avatar.
Inky, the blue, set him position 
avatar's front but
depending of Blinky's distance 
and angle position.
Clyde, the orange, chase 
avatar in front but he scatter 
around when is to near.

Strategy Pattern!
For develop the different 
ghost behaviour, 
it was implemented
Strategy Desing Pattern
to get a flexible and
reusable object oriented
software.

A one level Pac-Man clone made in
C++ with Simple DirecMedia Layer.


This simple 2D proyect is a 
one level Pac-Man clone made in
C++ with Simple DirecMedia Layer.
An excelent exercise for get started
in gaming development to understand
basic concepts, creating characters
scenarios and behaviours using sprites, 
geometric posicionation, objects comunication,
artificial inteligent. And it also could
be challenger for experienced developers
writing precise and optimal algorithms,
being careful managing pointers and references
and implementing software desing patters.
